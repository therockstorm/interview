Word Break
 Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

2. Given input which is a vector of (user name, log-in time, log-out time), output time series which will have number of users logged in at each given time slot in the input,
 output should only contain time slots which are given in input for example if the input is
 "September", 1.2, 4.5),
("June", 3.1, 6.7),
("August", 8.9, 10.3)

output should contain only 1.2, 3.1, 4.5, 3.1, 6.7, 8.9, 10.3

Example:
/*
[
("September", 1.2, 4.5),
("June", 3.1, 6.7),
("August", 8.9, 10.3)
]

=>

[(1.2, 1), (3.1, 2), (4.5, 1), (6.7, 0), (8.9, 1), (10.3, 0)]

Given an input string of numbers like 121, find all permutations of that number in the same order for the corresponding letters for each number so 121 => 1 2 1, 12 1, and 1 21 which is ABA, LA, and AT

Given an array of Ints find a maximum sum of non adjacent elements.
for ex. arr = [1,0,3,9,2] then ans would be 10 = 1 + 9 (non adjacent element)

Implement data structure "Map" storing pairs of integers (key, value) and define following member functions in O(1) runtime: void insert(key, value), void delete(key), int get(key), int getRandomKey().
Given a string A and B, find the smallest substring of A that contains all the characters from B. (implement solution in O(n), keep in mind chars in B can repeat)
Given a picture of square with a bunch of horizontal and vertical lines in it (lines are not necessarily spanning the full square length, in other words think of a fine grid with many holes in it), design data structure(s) representing the data and a function that returns a number of squares pictured. (actual implementation expected)

Sketch design of a project you participated in. (on whiteboard)

input a list of array [[1, 2, 3], [1], [1, 2]] return the list of array, each array is a combination of one element in each array.
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2]]
Followup: each array in the input list is an iterator, which can only be looped once.

Write an algorithm to determine if all of the delimiters in an expression are matched and closed.{(abc)22}[14(xyz)2] should pass

Given a message "one two three four five six seven eight nine", chop it in chunks(no exceed the give buffer size) and print out to the screen. Need to maintain the word and do not chop it off.
I.E.: buffer size is 15
one two three (1/4)
four five six (2/4)
seven eight (3/4)
nine (4/4)

Given a set of sudoku boards, determine whether a board is valid or not.
