Given a set of numbers and another number, find all pairs in the set that add up to given number, Given an array of positive and negative integers, find all pairs which add up to a given number
How would you extract all unique members of a set?
Describe how you would implement: a basic list of contacts that supports phone, address, email, contact photos with the following functionality: Add, delete, update, view a contact (with different amounts of info based on view), Please write down your answer and include a design or a class diagram.
prepare a program and present it
Implement fibonacci
1) Construct a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array
2) Reverse a linked List
3) Return the next in order node in a tree using a reference to a single node.
4) Find the employees with the highest salary (SQL crap)
5) Find the employees with the highest salary from every department
6) Implement an LRU cache
